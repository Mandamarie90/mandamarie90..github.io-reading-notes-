1. **What is the main intended use case for the `useEffect` hook?**
   - The main intended use case for the `useEffect` hook is to perform side effects in function components, such as data fetching, subscriptions, or manually changing the DOM.

2. **How does the effect’s logic interact with the component?**
   - The effect’s logic interacts with the component by running after the render phase, allowing it to execute side effects based on the component’s state and props.

3. **What is the importance of the return value from the effect’s logic function?**
   - The return value from the effect’s logic function is important because it can be used to clean up or undo the side effects, which is useful for managing subscriptions, timers, or any resources that need to be released to prevent memory leaks.
