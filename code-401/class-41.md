### React Native Core Components

1. **View**: A fundamental component for building the layout of an app, similar to a `<div>` in web development.
2. **Text**: Used to display text content in the app.
3. **Image**: Used to display images, either from local resources or remote URLs.

### React Native Problem Solving

**Problem Solved**: React Native enables the development of mobile apps using JavaScript and React, allowing for the creation of native app experiences across both iOS and Android platforms with a single codebase.

### Building Blocks Comparison

**Building Blocks**: The building blocks of a React Native app are components like `View`, `Text`, and `Image`, which are analogous to HTML elements in a React app but tailored for mobile platforms.

### Expo

**Solution Provided**: Expo provides a framework and platform for universal React applications, simplifying the development process by offering tools and services that manage native build configurations.
**Workflow**: Managed workflow.
**Difference from React Native**: Expo is a framework built on top of React Native, offering additional tools and services to streamline app development, whereas React Native is the core framework for building mobile apps using React.

### Expo Snack

**Snack Functionality**: Snack allows you to write, run, and share React Native code directly in a web browser, providing an interactive playground for experimenting with React Native projects.

### Ejecting from Expo

**Eject Definition**: "Eject" means to move from the managed workflow provided by Expo to a bare workflow, giving you full control over the native code and configurations.
**When Not to Eject**: You should not eject if you want to continue benefiting from Expoâ€™s managed workflow and its simplicity for managing app development.
**Why Eject**: You might choose to eject if you need to use custom native code or libraries not supported by Expo, or if you require more control over the native build configuration.
