# Node Ecosystem

#### How would you describe Node to a non-technical friend?

Imagine Node.js as a powerful toolbox for building all sorts of web applications. It's like having a special set of tools that allows developers to create interactive and dynamic websites. Just like how a carpenter uses different tools to build furniture, programmers use Node.js to craft websites and web applications. It's a popular choice because it's fast, efficient, and can handle lots of users at once, making it great for anything from simple blogs to complex social networks.

#### What does it mean that Node is a JavaScript runtime?

Node.js is a platform that lets developers run JavaScript code on servers, not just in web browsers.

#### What is Node used for?

Node.js is used for building web servers, APIs, real-time applications like chat apps, and command-line tools.

#### Looking ahead at this moduleâ€™s course schedule, What do you look forward to learning?

I'm looking forward to learning about building REST APIs, React, Redux, and working on the Capstone Project.

#### What are your learning goals after reading and reviewing the class README?

My learning goals are to understand Node.js, write modular code, master Test-Driven Development, set up Continuous Integration with GitHub Actions, and deploy applications using Continuous Deployment to the cloud.
