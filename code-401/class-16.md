### What is an EC2 Instance?
An EC2 instance is a virtual server provided by Amazon Web Services (AWS) that you can use to run applications on the cloud. It offers scalable computing capacity to support various workloads.

### Name 2 use cases for EC2.
1. Hosting web applications with dynamic scaling to handle varying traffic loads.
2. Running large-scale data processing tasks and analytics.

### Provide 1 reason to use ECS instead of a service such as Heroku, Digital Ocean, or Render.com.
ECS offers deeper integration with other AWS services, providing more control over the infrastructure and easier management of complex applications at scale.

### Where can we find EC2 on the AWS Console?
You can find EC2 under the "Compute" section of the AWS Management Console.

### Explain the general difference between T2 Micro and XL.
T2 Micro is a small, low-cost instance with limited CPU and memory resources, suitable for low-traffic applications. XL instances are much larger, offering significantly more CPU and memory for handling high-performance workloads.

### Explain a “Compute Cycle” to a non-technical friend.
A compute cycle is like a unit of work that a computer does, similar to a single task or operation completed by the computer's processor.

### What is Elastic Beanstalk?
Elastic Beanstalk is a platform-as-a-service (PaaS) provided by AWS that simplifies the deployment and management of applications by automatically handling the underlying infrastructure.

### Describe the relationship between EC2 and Elastic Beanstalk.
Elastic Beanstalk manages EC2 instances for you, allowing you to focus on your application code rather than the infrastructure details.

### Name some benefits of using Elastic Beanstalk.
1. Simplifies the deployment process with automated scaling and monitoring.
2. Provides easy integration with other AWS services and supports multiple programming languages and environments.
