When selecting a data structure to solve a problem, one crucial consideration is the efficiency of operations performed on the data structure given the problem's requirements. For example, if the problem requires frequent insertion and deletion of elements, a linked list might be more suitable due to its constant-time insertion and deletion at any position. On the other hand, if the problem requires fast retrieval of elements by their keys, a hash table or a balanced binary search tree like AVL or Red-Black tree might be more appropriate.

To avoid an infinite recursive call stack, you can follow these strategies:

1. **Base Case**: Ensure that your recursive function has a base case that terminates the recursion. This is a condition where the function does not make further recursive calls and instead returns a value.

2. **Progress Toward Base Case**: Ensure that each recursive call brings you closer to the base case. In other words, make sure that the parameters passed to the recursive calls are modified in a way that eventually leads to reaching the base case.

3. **Limit Recursion Depth**: In languages that support tail call optimization (TCO), you can rewrite your recursive functions to use tail recursion, where the recursive call is the last operation performed by the function. This allows the compiler to optimize away the recursive calls, preventing stack overflow. However, not all languages support TCO.

4. **Iterative Alternatives**: Consider whether the problem can be solved iteratively instead of recursively. Iterative solutions often consume less memory and are less likely to cause stack overflow errors.

By following these strategies, you can ensure that your recursive functions terminate correctly and avoid infinite recursive call stacks.
