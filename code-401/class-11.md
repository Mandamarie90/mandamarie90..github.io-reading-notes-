### What native Node.js module allows us to get started with Event Driven Programming?

The `events` module in Node.js is essential for event-driven programming. It includes the `EventEmitter` class which allows you to create, listen, and react to events in your application.

### What is the value of Object Oriented Programming used in tandem with Event Driven Programming?

Combining Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) with Event-Driven Programming (EDP) enhances modularity, maintainability, reusability, and scalability. This approach allows developers to build robust and efficient applications by structuring code into objects that can independently manage and respond to events.

### How is Event Driven Programming useful on the backend using Node.js?

Think of a busy restaurant where each waiter is responsible for specific tasks but remains ready to respond to new tasks as they come up, without standing idle. Node.js uses a similar approach on websites' backends, where parts of the application wait for certain events (like user actions) and respond to them without stopping other tasks. This makes processing efficient and quick, especially for operations that involve waiting, such as loading data or files.
