#### What occurred during the same time as the beginning of the decline of women in computer science?

The decline of women in computer science coincided with the rise of personal computers in U.S. homes. As personal computers became more common, the percentage of women in computer science flattened and then declined, while the share of women in other technical fields continued to rise.

#### Why does it matter that males had been playing on computers growing up?

It matters that males had been playing on computers growing up because it contributed to a narrative that computers were primarily for boys. This narrative, reinforced by marketing and cultural representations, shaped perceptions of who belonged in the field of computer science. Families were more likely to buy computers for boys, leading to a gap in computer experience between male and female students when they entered college. This gap affected female students' confidence and performance in computer science classes.

#### When are diversity efforts most successful?

Diversity efforts are most successful when they are driven by a commitment from company leaders who understand why diversity matters. This commitment involves understanding and acknowledging the benefits of diversity and inclusion, such as the ability to build stronger, more innovative teams.

#### Why do diverse companies perform better?

Diverse companies perform better because they benefit from the creativity, innovation, and different perspectives that diverse teams bring. Research shows a strong correlation between diverse organizations and positive financial outcomes. For example, studies have found that female representation in top management leads to an increase in firm value, and racial and gender diversity at executive and board levels are linked to better company performance.

#### Give an example of how a diverse company can serve a diverse user base or vise-versa.

An example of how a diverse company can better serve a diverse user base is illustrated by the case of YouTube's iOS app development. When the developer team, which was almost entirely right-handed, built the app without considering left-handed users, it resulted in 5% to 10% of videos being uploaded upside down. This shows how the diversity of employees in an organization can influence the quality and effectiveness of products for different user groups.
