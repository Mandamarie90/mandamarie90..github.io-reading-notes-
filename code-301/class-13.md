Whatâ€™s the relationship between REST and CRUD?
CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) represents the basic operations performed on data in a database. REST (Representational State Transfer) is an architectural style for designing networked applications. In a RESTful API, CRUD operations are typically mapped to HTTP methods: Create (POST), Read (GET), Update (PUT/PATCH), and Delete (DELETE).

If you had to describe the process of creating a RESTful API in 5 steps, what would they be?
- Define Resources: Identify the data entities (resources) your API will expose, such as users, products, or orders.
- Design URIs: Determine the URI structure for accessing each resource. Use meaningful and hierarchical paths, following RESTful principles.
- Choose HTTP Methods: Assign appropriate HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, PATCH, DELETE) to each URI based on the desired CRUD operations.
- Implement Handlers: Write code to handle incoming requests to your API endpoints. This involves implementing logic for processing requests, interacting with a database, and generating responses.
- Test and Document: Test your API endpoints to ensure they behave as expected. - Document the API, including URI patterns, supported HTTP methods, request/response formats, and any authentication/authorization mechanisms.
