## Node.js

#### What is node.js?
Node.js is a runtime environment that allows you to run JavaScript code on the server-side, outside of a web browser. It's known for its event-driven, non-blocking I/O model, making it lightweight and efficient for building fast and scalable network applications.

#### In your own words, what is Chrome’s V8 JavaScript Engine?
Chrome's V8 JavaScript Engine is a high-performance open-source JavaScript engine developed by Google for the Chrome web browser. It's designed to execute JavaScript code quickly and efficiently, compiling it directly into machine code for faster execution.

#### What does it mean that node is a JavaScript runtime?

## Pair Programming

#### What are the 6 reasons for pair programming?
Six reasons for pair programming include:

- **Higher Quality Code**: Two heads are better than one, leading to fewer bugs and better-designed solutions.

- **Faster Problem Solving**: Collaboration often results in faster issue resolution and problem-solving.

- **Knowledge Sharing**: Pair programming allows team members to share knowledge and learn from each other.

- **Improved Focus**: Having a partner helps maintain focus and accountability during coding sessions.

- **Better Communication**: Pair programming fosters better communication and teamwork among team members.

- **Continuous Feedback**: Immediate feedback from a partner helps catch mistakes early and improve overall code quality.

#### In your experience, which of these reasons have you found most beneficial?
Improved focus.

#### How does pair programming work?

In pair programming, two developers work together at one workstation. One writes the code (the "driver"), while the other reviews it (the "navigator"). They switch roles periodically, collaborating to write better code faster.
