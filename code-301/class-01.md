#### What is a “component”?
A component is like a building block for making web interfaces. It's a piece of code that you can reuse and customize. You can use components to create different parts of a website or application, and they manage their own data and behavior. 

#### What are the characteristics of a component?
React components are reusable, self-contained building blocks for creating user interfaces. They can be combined, manage their own data, respond to user actions, and use props to receive data from other components.

#### What are the advantages of using component-based architecture?
- Reuse: Components can be used again and again.
- Modularity: Code is divided into smaller, manageable parts.
- Composition: Components can be combined to create complex interfaces.
- Isolation: Each component manages its own state, making debugging easier.
- Performance: React's efficient rendering improves application speed.
- Community: React's popularity means a wealth of resources and tools are available.

#### What is “props” short for?
"properties".

#### How are props used in React?
To pass data from the parent to the child component in a unidirectional flow. 

#### What is the flow of props?
Props flow in one direction only, from parent to child. Changes to props in a parent component trigger re-renders in the child component, but changes in the child component do not affect the parent or other components.
