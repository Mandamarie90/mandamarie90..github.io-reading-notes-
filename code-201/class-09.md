#### How would you describe events to a non-technical friend?

Events in computing are like actions or occurrences that happen within a program or on a webpage, such as clicking a button, hovering over an image, or pressing a key on the keyboard, which can trigger specific reactions or functions to be executed.

#### When using the addEventListener() method, what 2 arguments will you need to provide?

When using the addEventListener() method, you'll need to provide the type of event you want to listen for (e.g., "click", "mouseover") as the first argument, and a function that should be executed when the event occurs as the second argument.

#### Describe the event object. Why is the target within the event object useful?

The event object contains information about the event that occurred, including properties like the event type, target element, and additional data, with the target property particularly useful as it references the element on which the event was triggered, allowing for specific actions or manipulations to be performed on that element.

#### What is the difference between event bubbling and event capturing?


Event bubbling is the propagation of an event from the innermost target element up to the outermost ancestor, while event capturing is the opposite process, starting from the outermost ancestor and moving down to the target element.
