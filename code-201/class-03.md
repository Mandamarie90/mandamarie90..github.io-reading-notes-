### HTML

#### When should you use an unordered list in your HTML document?

Use ul in HTML for lists of items without a specific order, like navigation menus or bullet-point lists. It adds semantic meaning for accessibility and styling control with CSS.

#### How do you change the bullet style of unordered list items?

You can change the bullet style of unordered list items in CSS using the list-style-type property. Set it to values like disc, circle, square, or even none to remove bullets altogether. 

#### When should you use an ordered list vs an unorder list in your HTML document?

Use an ordered list ol when presenting items in a specific sequence like steps or rankings. Use an unordered list ul when the order of items isn't significant like lists of options or bullet-pointed information.

#### Describe two ways you can change the numbers on list items provided by an ordered list?

By using the start attribute on the ol element to specify a starting number for the list. For example, ol start="3", will start numbering the list items from 3 instead of 1. Or by using the list-style-type property with values like decimal, lower-roman, or upper-alpha.

### CSS

#### List and describe the four parts of an HTML elements box as referred to by the box model.

- Content: The text of the HTML element.
- Padding: Space between the content and the border.
- Border: The line or boundary around the padding and content.
