### CSS Transforms

#### What does a CSS transform allow the developer to do to an element?

A CSS transform allows developers to modify the appearance and position of an element in various ways without affecting its layout in the document flow. With transforms, developers can rotate, scale, skew, or translate elements along the X, Y, or Z axes. This provides the flexibility to create visually engaging effects, such as rotating an image, scaling up a button on hover, or sliding in a menu from off-screen. CSS transforms offer a powerful toolset for enhancing the user experience and adding dynamism to web designs with minimal impact on performance.

#### Provide an example of a transform and how you could see that being used on a website.

A CSS transform, like rotating an image with transform: rotate(45deg);, can add visual interest to a website. It's handy for animating logos, indicating navigation directions with arrows, or creating dynamic effects in sliders or carousels.

### CSS Transitions & Animations

#### What does a CSS transition allow the developer to do to an element?

Allows developers to smoothly animate changes in an element's style or appearance over a specified duration. By defining the properties to transition and their duration, developers can create fluid transitions between different states of an element, such as hover effects, color changes, or size adjustments. With transitions, elements can seamlessly transform from one style to another, enhancing the user experience by adding polish and interactivity to web interfaces without the need for JavaScript animations.

#### How does a CSS animation differ from a CSS transition?

CSS transitions enable smooth changes in an element's style over a specified time, while CSS animations provide more control and flexibility, allowing developers to define keyframes with specific style changes at different points in time for more complex and custom animations.
