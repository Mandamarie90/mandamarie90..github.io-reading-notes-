### CSS Flexbox
#### Flexbox is designed for one-dimensional content. Explain what this means.

Flexbox is designed for one-dimensional layouts, focusing on arranging elements along a single axisâ€”either horizontally or vertically. It provides flexible control over alignment and distribution of space within a container, making it ideal for responsive designs, while CSS Grid is better suited for two-dimensional layouts with both rows and columns.

#### Explain the difference between the main axis and cross axis.

The main axis is the primary axis along which flex items are laid out in a flex container. It's determined by the flex-direction property and can be either horizontal or vertical. The cross axis is perpendicular to the main axis. It's used for alignment and distribution of flex items when there is extra space in the container along the main axis. Understanding and manipulating both axes is crucial for effectively designing and controlling layouts using Flexbox.

#### How can using certain properties of flexbox negatively impact accessibility?

Using properties like order to change the visual order of elements can negatively impact accessibility by disrupting the natural reading order, potentially confusing users relying on screen readers or navigating via keyboard.

#### What are some advantages of using flexbox over float?

Flexbox offers advantages over floats such as easier vertical centering, dynamic content resizing without collapsing parent containers, and simpler alignment and spacing controls, enhancing layout flexibility and reducing reliance on hacks or workarounds.
