## Debugging

#### Name some key differences between a Syntax Error and a Logic Error.

A syntax error occurs when code violates the rules of a programming language, while a logic error occurs when code produces unintended or incorrect results due to flawed reasoning or algorithms.

#### List a few types of errors that you have encountered in past lab assignments and explain how you were able to correct them.

- Syntax Errors: Corrected by reviewing and fixing code to adhere to language rules.
- Logic Errors: Fixed through debugging techniques like tracing and adjusting code logic.
- Runtime Errors: Resolved by implementing appropriate error handling and boundary checks.
- Semantic Errors: Addressed by consulting documentation and seeking assistance for correct usage.

#### How will this topic continue to influence your long term goals?

Mastering debugging techniques and error handling will ensure more robust software development, contributing to career advancement and the creation of innovative technologies.

#### How would you describe the JavaScript Debugger tool and how it works to someone just starting out in software development?

Finds and fix errors in JavaScript code. It allows users to pause code execution, inspect variables, and step through code line by line to identify issues.

#### Define what a breakpoint is.

A breakpoint is a marker set by a developer in their code, indicating a specific point where program execution should pause, allowing for inspection of variables and analysis of program state during debugging.

#### What is the call stack?

The call stack is a data structure that tracks the active functions in a program's execution, enabling the program to return to the correct point after completing each function.
