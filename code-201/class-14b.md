In the urgent care setting where I worked as a medical assistant, psychological safety was fostered through clear communication, mutual respect, and a supportive environment. Team members felt comfortable expressing their ideas and concerns, valued each other's contributions, and provided support both professionally and personally. This facilitated effective teamwork, collaboration, and ultimately, improved patient care.
