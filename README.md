### Bio
Hello, lovely souls! ✨ Amanda Marquez here (she/her), based in **beautiful** Bonney Lake, WA. Former medical assistant turned aspiring software engineer, chasing my tech dreams one line of code at a time. When I'm not immersed in the world of programming, you can find me exploring the great outdoors - hiking *majestic* trails, gliding through *serene* waters on a kayak or paddleboard, shredding *fresh powder* on my snowboard, and even venturing into winter *wonderlands* with snowshoes strapped on. And let's not forget about my adorable feline companion named ***Kitty*** who adds an extra dash of purrfection to my life. Join me on this exciting journey as I blend the realms of technology and nature with a touch of feline charm! 🌲🏔️🐾

#### Growth Mindset

Having a growth mindset means believing that everything can be learned and viewing challenges as a growth opportunity. To keep a growth mindset I can create a routine where I dedicate the same amount of time each day to growth. It can be reading, studying, practicing, or building. The key is to make it a daily habit. I can also communicate regularly with a mentor and remind myself of my goals. It is important to evaluate my goals regularly as they will shift.
