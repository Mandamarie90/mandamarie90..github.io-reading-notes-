### Growth Mindset

Having a growth mindset means believing that everything can be learned and seeing challenges as a growth opportunity. To keep a growth mindset I can create a routine where I dedicate the same amount of time each day to growth. It can be reading, studying, practicing, or building. The key is to make it a daily habit. I can also communicate regularly with a mentor and remind myself of my goals. It is important to evaluate my goals regularly as they will shift.
